Overview

The Crop Recommendation System project utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to recommend the most suitable crops for farmers based on environmental factors, soil conditions, and geographical location. By analyzing historical data, the system aims to optimize crop yield and improve farming practices, helping farmers make data-driven decisions.

Outcome

Personalized Recommendations: Suggests optimal crops based on user input (e.g., soil type, climate).
Format: Output as recommendations, supported by key data points (e.g., yield potential, growth season).
Predictive Analytics:

Key Metrics: Visualizations or tables showing predicted crop success, optimal planting periods, and expected yield.
Customizable Views: Options for farmers to filter recommendations by region, soil type, or climate conditions.
